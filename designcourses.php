                    <p>The College is an internationally connected creative community of diverse disciplines housed
                        under one roof. We shape our students' futures, preparing them to shape the world through
                        applied knowledge and creativity.</p>
                    <p>The College's art and design courses don't just train you, they promote alternative ways of
                        thinking, making and communicating; they provide you with space, tools and inspiration to
                        develop your creative practice and a clear career path. You'll get expert teaching from active
                        practitioners and researchers who will encourage you to adopt innovative and resourceful
                        approaches that both perceive and create opportunities for better lives.</p>
                    <p>Youâ€™ll develop your creative practice whilst interacting with your peers in well-equipped
                        studios, making and digital workshops. At the same time, you'll learn professional skills by
                        working on applied briefs facilitated through our links with commercial clients, cultural
                        institutions, businesses and organisations.
